ReFuelJS Framework
========

###### ReFuel is a fast and flexible mobile-first Javascript framework aimed to easily develop web applications.

##### Fast
Having fast and memory-efficient code is our primary goal. To achieve this we use a set of tools to benchmark ReFuel and deliver fast and memory-efficient code.

##### Mobile-first
ReFuel main target is the mobile world. Thus, our framework is intended to be used on a HTML5, CSS and plain old Javascript environment.

##### Flexible
Are you using JQuery, Dojo or even Prototype? You can use ReFuel with no worries at all with your favourite library. We are keeping all of this as simple as we can, using a modular architecture so you can plug-in or out whatever your needs are.

##### Stable
Developers knows that stability makes the difference choosing between frameworks. We have chosen to adopt a fully Test-Driven development in an Agile environment to assure developers we're doing this in the right and reliable way.

##### Easy to use
The most important thing is to easily handle data, could those be on a local storage or on a remote server (just like a REST API), doesnâ€™t matter. Get, filter, and then show: we will take care updating the WebApp for you. With love.
